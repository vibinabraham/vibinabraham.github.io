## Green Software Package

The **Green Software Package** enables the simulation of realistic materials at finite temperatures using Green's function methods. It implements a range of many-body techniques, including self-energy embedding, self-consistent GW, and second-order perturbation theory, applicable to both solids and molecules.

For more information and to access the software, visit the [Green Software Package](https://green-phys.org/) page.


## FermiCluster Package

[FermiCluster](https://github.com/vibinabraham/FermiCluster) is a Python library that efficiently solves fermionic many-body problems by partitioning systems into strongly interacting clusters and utilizing approximate methods to capture correlation between clusters.
